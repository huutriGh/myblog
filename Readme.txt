===========JSP============
Understand the syntax of JSPs
Including other pages dynamically
Including other resources
Using Script on the page
==========MVC============
Well know pattern for UI applications
Originally from Smalltalk
Web MVC is not quite the same
Servlet as Controller
JSP used as the View
Bean used as model(POJO)
=========Jakarta Expression Language=========
JSP relied on Java as the scripting language
Make it difficult to produce dynamic pages.
JSP 2.0 introduced an EL
EL is very 'page-author' friendly
Allows page authors a limited form of page scripting

EL Base on
Nested properties
Access to collection classes
Operators (Relational; logical; arithmetic)
Extensibility function (mapped to static Java methods)
A set of implicit object
Syntax
    Always use ${expr} construct
EL can be used on page
    This will simply output the value of the expression
EL can be used in attributes
Not a "full" language
